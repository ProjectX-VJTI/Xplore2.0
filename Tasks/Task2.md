## Task 2:

Morse Code Decoding

You’ll be given a grayscale image
```
Each pixel value corresponds to
  - 255 -> (.)
  - 0 -> (-)
  - 120-220 -> separator
```
The code should return the correct morse code represented by the image. The code is not required to decode the morse code. ***For example: “HELLO” in morse code is written as[ .... . .-.. .-.. ---]***

Upload the code as per the instructions in the readme file.
