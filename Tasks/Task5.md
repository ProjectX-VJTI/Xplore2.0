## Task 5:

Count and Classify Shapes in an Image

You have been given an image that contains multiple filled geometric shapes (e.g., circles, rectangles, triangles).

The task is to use OpenCV to:

```
- Detect all the shapes in the image
- Count the total number of shapes
- Classify the shapes and create a dictionary to store count of each type of shape you detect.
```
