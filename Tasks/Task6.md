## Task 6:

You have been given an image containing multiple colored objects.

#### The task is to use OpenCV to:

```
- Detect and isolate the colour red in the image.
- Convert the rest of the image to grayscale
- Keep only the detected color in its original form for a color splash effect
```

The output image should look like this:
