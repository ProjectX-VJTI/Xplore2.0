## Task 5:

Try to recreate the given image using your knowledge of drawing shapes in OpenCV. It does not have to be exact, but aim to create a visually similar representation.

**Note:** Instead of approximating the coordinates manually, try using mathematical operations based on the image's shape (e.g., its width and height) to calculate the positions of the shapes dynamically.
